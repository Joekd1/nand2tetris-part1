### Background:

This is the next part in my journey of going through the [Rusty CS courses.](https://github.com/AbdesamedBendjeddou/Rusty-CS)  

I regret not fully documenting the other parts (I get self-conscious when sharing publicly) but better late than ever, I guess.  

I found it extremely satisfying to implement a mini-programming langauge in Racket as part of the Coursera Programming Languages course. So why not take it even further and implement everything? This is why I am excited to go through Nand2Tetris.  

I decided to mainly use the book instead of the courses, I can select the pace better that way.

### Journey so far:
- Finished the Coursera Programming Languages part A, B and C.
- Worked through the Rust book
- Worked through the first 4 chapters of *Discrete Mathematics with Applications* by *Susanna Epp* (5th ed)
