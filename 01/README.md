## Chapter 1 : Boolean Logic

### Reading notes:
- The universality of the Nand gate: every boolean function can be realized using Nand only.
- Two ways to represent a boolean function : truth tables and boolean expression. 
- It is important to be able to convert between the two.
- A gate is a physical device that implements a simple Boolean function.
- Logic design : Finding the most efficient way to implement a logic gate from its specification. 
- We use HDL (Hardware Desciption Language) to design and simulate the gates.

### Not Gate:

Given the rules of Boolean algebra : ` ~ a = ~ (a ^ t)` which is equivalent to a Nand(a, True)
