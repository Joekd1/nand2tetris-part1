## Chapter 4 : Machine Language 

### Reading notes:
- Before we complete our hardware platfrom we have to understand its purpose and its function.
- We have to study the *machine language* that our platfrom seeks to realize.
- A *machine language* can be defined as an agreed upon formalism designed to manipulate *memory* using a *processor* and a set of *registers*. 
- The machine language is specific to the hardware system.
- This chapter introduces the *Hack Machine Language*, its specification and examples.


### Multi.asm:

The input of the program are the values stored in R0 and R1. The program computes R0 * R1 and stores and value in R2. 
I solved this problem using addition in a loop. 

### Fill.asm:

The program runs an infinite loop that checks the value of @KBD and then blackens the entire screen when a key is pressed and whitens it otherwise.
